# Guide to construction
If you want to do a job, like Station Engineer, you need to know how to build and deconstruct stuff.

## Basic Tools
Before you can begin any construction or deconstruction you need to gather a few useful tools.

These tools can be found in any blue Mechanical Toolbox on the station. They can also be made in an Autolathe or dispensed from a YouTool-vending machine.

- Crowbar
- Screwdriver
- Welder
- Wirecutters

Just like a lattice, except you can place wires on it.

<b>How to build</b>
Use the rods on a lattice.

<b>How to deconstruct</b>
Use wirecutters to cut the catwalk into 2 rods.

#### Plating
The basic floor which you put things like wires and pipes upon. 'All' floors and walls are built on top of this.

<b>How to build</b>
Use a floor tile on a lattice.

<b>How to deconstruct</b>
Use a crowbar on broken plating, otherwise it does not deconstruct.
Can be deconstructed with an RCD.

<b>How to repair</b>
Use a welder on broken plating to repair it.

#### Steel Floor
This is the basic "nice" floor, this floor should be considered used in all public areas, hence why there's none of these in maintenance tunnels.

<b>How to build</b>
Use a floor tile on plating.

<b>How to deconstruct</b>
Use a crowbar on a floor tile to remove it. It will be destroyed if broken.

#### Wood Floor
This is a fancy floor, used in the library and similar places.

<b>How to build</b>
Use a wood tile on plating. Wood tiles can be made of planks of wood.

<b>How to deconstruct</b>
Detach the tile with a screwdriver.
Alternately:
Destroy it with a crowbar. This will not give you a wood tile back.

#### Reinforced Floor
This is a reinforced floor, used in science and similar areas for better protection against fire or explosions.

<b>How to build</b>
Use rods on a plating.

<b>How to deconstruct</b>
Use a wrench to dismantle it to two rods.

#### Carpeted Floor
This is a carpeted floor, used to make your office look fancy.

2. 

### Walls

#### Normal Wall
This is the standard type of wall found around the station, they are easy to construct and remove but are not as strong as reinforced walls. They also come in a hidden door variety. Walls can also be made out of different minerals. They're useful for:

To turn a normal wall into a hidden door, deconstruct it until the final screwdriving of the girder, and instead use 2 sheet of metal on the girder.

<b>How to deconstruct</b>
1. Screwdriver to tighten the bolts and turn it into a regular wall. Or...
2. Weld to dismantle the false wall.
3. Screwdriver again to disassemble the girder.

<b>How to deconstruct</b>

Normal window (including plasmaglass):
  1. Screwdriver to unscrew the window from the floor.
  2. Wrench to deconstruct the window.
Hitting a normal pane repeatedly with a weapon will smash it into glass shards. Normal windows have 50 integrity (health), while plasma windows have 300. Directional windows have half integrity.

Reinforced window (including reinforced plasmaglass):
  1. Screwdriver
  2. Crowbar
  3. Screwdriver
  4. Wrench
Reinforced windows require a melee item over 11 damage to damage at all, have 150 integrity, and 80 melee armor. This is approximately 1 minute of sustained beating with a toolbox. Reinforced plasma windows require a melee item over 21 damage to damage at all, have 1000 integrity, and 80 melee armor. Breaks down into glass shards and a metal rods. Directional windows have half integrity.

<b>How to build</b>
1. Stand where you want the chair.
2. Pick up some metal or planks.
3. Click it in hand.
4. Select Chair from menu.

<b>How to deconstruct</b>

#### Lockers
<p>
Lockers are among the most common and arguably the most useful of containers on the station. Nearly anything can fit inside, barring other lockers, crates, and certain especially large objects like racks and MULEbots.
</p>
<p>
Besides being welded shut, some lockers can be, well, locked. Several levels of access exist, such as security-, captain-, and private-level access. These can be opened with the proper level identification card, emag item, or with enough damage. If you don't want to take out your id to open these every time, you can alt-click them to lock/unlock them.
</p>
<p>
If you yourself are inside a locker, you can see your surroundings. Normally you can move in any direction to exit the locker, but if the locker is locked or welded, you will be unable to exit and you cannot unweld or unlock your cell from inside - at that point if you try to move around you will instead throw yourself against the sides of the locker, making a BANG BANG sound that can be heard from several squares away. Using the Resist button will allow you to slowly open the locker.
</p>
<p>
Coffins count as lockers.
</p>

<b>How to build</b>
1. Stand where you want the locker.

1. Activate metal in hand.
2. Choose Rack from the list.
3. Stand where you want the rack.

# Machines

### Machine Construction Steps
1. Build a machine frame from your 5 metal sheets.
2. Add wires.
3. Wrench it.
4. Add a circuitboard.
5. Examine the machine frame and it will tell you what items you need now.
6. When all the parts are added, screwdriver the machine frame to finish it.

### Linking Machines
Certain machines need to be linked to other machines or computers in order to work properly. There's different methods for different machines:
- Telecommunications machines, Quantum Pad, Mech Bay Power Port and some others: Using a multitool to download and upload data to link two devices which can sometimes require to open the machine's panel with a screwdriver first.
- R&D machines, Turbine, Cloning Pod, DNA Scanner: Interacting with a console to find nearby machines.
- Teleporter Station: Using wirecutters after opening the panel with a screwdriver.

## Autholathe

## Ore Silo
Stores sheets of materials and shares them with linked machines. Ore Redemption Machines, Techfabs, Protolathes and Circuit Imprinters can be linked to it by first using a multitool on the ore silo, and then using the same multitool on the machine you wish to link it to. By default, the pre-built Ore Silo is already linked to those machines that exist roundstart. Typically found in the Vault.

Clicking the ore silo opens a menu. This menu can be used to unlink machines, and gives you a list of items/materials that have been printed from linked machines, and the area locations of them. Useful if the ORM gets stolen. You can eject/insert materials directly into the silo. If the silo is destroyed, all inserted materials in its linked system will be ejected from it.

## Nanite Machinery
## Nanite Chamber
Used for implanting non-synchronised (non-cloud) nanites, as well as modifying options of already implanted nanite swarms. Must be operated by a second person with an adjacent Nanite Chamber Control Console (they link automatically). Click the nanite chamber to open it, click-drag a person to put them into the chamber, and then click the console for a menu. With a subject in the chamber, start by clicking "Implant Nanites". This will implant a nanite swarm in the subject. These nanites will not have any programs yet, so they do nothing except generate nanite volume. To install programs you first need to get a nanite program disk with a program on it from a Nanite Program Hub. You have two optional ways to install the program:

1. Without cloud sync: Put the program disk into the nanite chamber control console and click Install Program From Disk. This will install that single program in the subject inside the scanner. Cloud ID must stay set to "No Cloud" or the program will be overwritten by the cloud.
2. With cloud sync: Instead of putting the disk into the nanite chamber control console, open its menu and use it to set a Cloud ID (such as 1). Put the program disk in another console; the Nanite Cloud Controller. Create a backup cloud with the same cloud ID as you just gave the subject (such as 1). Then click that backup and then "Upload Program From Disk". The program will then be installed in all implanted subjects with the same cloud ID within a minute.

Other options in this machine:
Safety Threshold: See Guide to Nanites.
Lock Chamber: Traps the person inside.
Uninstall (program): Removes an installed program (will only work with no cloud sync).

## Messaging Server
A machine that processes and routes PDA and request console messages. Takes 15 minutes of calibration before it works if newly constructed.<br />
Use a multitool to configure its settings and link it to the (tcommsat) network and hub. If there is no active messaging server, PDA and request console messages won't work.

<b>Part Needed</b><br />
  1x Messaging Server (Machine Board)<br />
  2x Micro manipulator<br />
  2x Hyperwave filters<br />
  1x Piece of cable<br />
  
<b>Upgrade effects</b><br />
None

## Bluespace Launchpad
Must be connected to and operated by a launchpad control console. To connect: Open the launchpad with a screwdriver then use a multitool on it to save it on the buffer. Close it, then go to a launchpad control console and use the multitool on it. The console does not need to be in the same area as the launchpad.

How to use: Use the connected launchpad control console. Click arrow buttons to choose a target tile from the launchpad's perspective (such as 5N, 5E). Click either "launch" to teleport things from the launchpad to the target destination, or click "pull" to teleport things from the target tile to the launchpad. Has a small delay before teleporting. Some things can't be teleported, such as anchored machines.

The targeted tile can be seen by people wearing diagnostic HUD.

<b>Part Needed</b><br />
  1x Bluespace Launchpad (Machine Board)<br />
  1x Micro manipulator<br />
  1x Bluespace crystal<br />
  
<b>Upgrade effects</b><br />
- <b>Better manipulator:</b> Increases maximum range by 15 per tier, up to 60.

## Quantum Pad
Can be linked to another quantum pad to set it as a target: when used, it will transfer everything on top of it to its target pad, after a delay, then goes on cooldown.

To link pads: Open the receiving pad with a screwdriver then use a multitool on it to save it on the buffer. Close it, then go to the sending pad and use the multitool on it without opening it. If you want them linked both ways, repeat the procedure with the opposite pads. You can also save a receiving pad to a Quantum Keycard. Simply use the Quantum Keycard on the receiving pad to save that pad as a custom destination. Then activate another quantum pad with the same keycard and it will activate a teleport to the quantum pad saved to the keycard, instead of to the destination saved to the pad.

<b>Part Needed</b><br />
  1x Quantum Pad Board<br />
  1x Micro manipulator<br />
  1x Bluespace crystal<br />
  1x Capacitor<br />
  1x Piece of cable<br />
  
<b>Upgrade effects</b><br />
- <b>Better capacitor:</b> Reduces power cost.
- <b>Better manipulator:</b> Reduces cooldown and chargeup time.

## Teleporter Station
Necessary to operate a Teleporter. Can be linked to other stations with screwdriver+multitool (first station) and then multitool (target station) to enable direct teleportation through Gate Mode. Otherwise it can only target Tracking Beacons. See Teleporter Station for detailed operation instructions.

<b>Part Needed</b><br />
  1x Teleportation Station Board<br />
  2x Bluespace crystal<br />
  2x Capacitor<br />
  1x Glass<br />
  
<b>Upgrade effects</b><br />
- <b>Better capacitor:</b> The station can be linked with more teleporter stations.

## Teleporter Hub
Generates a portal to use the Teleporter. Can teleport anything not anchored. See Teleporter Station for detailed operation instructions.

<b>Part Needed</b><br />
  1x Teleportation Hub Board<br />
  3x Bluespace crystal<br />
  1x Matter bins<br />
  
<b>Upgrade effects</b><br />
- <b>Better matter bins:</b> Lower the risk and severity of accidents. Removes need for calibration.

## Vendor
Vends several items. Can be hacked to unlock more items, and a few vendors also have special premium items.

<b>Part Needed</b><br />
  1x Vendor Board<br />
    (Use screwdriver to select Vendor type)<br />
    (DonkSoft vendors require a special board, which requires illegal technology research.)<br />
  1x Restocking Unit<br />
    (corresponding to the vendor type)<br />
    
<b>Upgrade effects</b><br />
None

## (Organ) Harvester
Harvests all organs and limbs from bodies placed inside. Only works on corpses, unless the safety function is disabled by emagging it.

<b>Part Needed</b><br />
  1x Harvester Board<br />
  4x Micro-laser<br />
    
<b>Upgrade effects</b><br />
- <b>Better micro-laser:</b> Increases the organ harvesting speed.

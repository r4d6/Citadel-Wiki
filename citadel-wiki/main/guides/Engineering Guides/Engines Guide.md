# Engines
The Engine is what power the Station, there are multiple types of engines, each with their own quirks, advantages and disaventages. Ranging from the simple Solar to the destructive Tesla, this guide will teach you how to do all of them, with pictures.
In this guide, everything that produce power will be called an engine.

## Solars
Starting with the easiest, most simple and safest of all engines, the <b>Solars</b>.
[Put Screenshot of a Solar Array here]
The Solars are a <i>secondary</i> engine, but it can power the station without much risk.
What is globaly refered to as the Solars are in fact four (Two on Pubby) solars array, put around the station.
Each of those Array can produce up to 90 kW, depending on the position of the (non-visible) sun. Generally, one will always be at maximum, with 2 others being in the middle and the last one being the lowest.
Each Array is made out of <b>Solar Panels</b> and a single <b>Solar Tracker</b>.
The Panels produce power and the Tracker follow the position of the sun.
They need to be connected by a wire to a <b>Solar Control Console</b>, which, if connected to a Tracker, will be able to automatically align the Panels with the Sun, producing as much power as possible for this array.
A good modification to make is to bypass the SMES that each array has and connect the Solar Array directly to the Grid.

## Antimatter Engine
This engine is about as simple as the Solars, but can be sabotaged more easily

- Shielding must be connected to a Control Unit to stay formed.
- Cores form when a shielding is surround by more shielding.
- Other Cores and Control Unit count as shielding.

- Each Antimatter fuel injected produce 400 kW.
- Each Core can support 2 Fuel each.
- Each Core can produce 800 kW.
- Injecting more than two times the number of cores in fuel reduce stability.
- Injecting more than 2 Fuel per core don't produce more power.
- When Stability reach 0, it explode with a force just over the maxcap.

Control Units are not ID-Lockable, meaning anyone can sabotage it.

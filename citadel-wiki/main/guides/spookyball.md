## Spooky Map

![#Map](/citadel-wiki/main/guides/images/map.png)

Above you can see the basic sections of the map! There's lots of secrets and stuff to find that isn't shown here, as well as the cave system itself that's hidden! Go and explore!

# How to build your own home

First of all, you'll want to visit the woodsman's hut to pick up a hatchet and a shovel (<i>If there's none left, hopefully an admin can spawn you some</i>). The hatchet lets you chop down trees by clicking on them to give you wood. This wood can be converted to planks by chopping them again. Using the planks in hand lets you make several things, but most importantly <b>Wooden barricades</b> which can be used to make <b> Wooden walls</b> by using 5 planks on them. Additionally, you can create <b>Wooden floors</b> by creating them in hand, using the shovel to dig up the ground, then applying the flooring to the dug up grass/turf.

## Grass crafting

To make a hay bed, wicker basket or a rice hat, cut up grass using a sharp object, then use the cut grass in hand.

## Mining

The caves themselves can be mined out using a pickaxe, so you can create your own secret network of stuff too!

# I can't see!

To the south of the bus is a house with lots of torches, as well as candles being avalible at the woodsman's hut. It's a good idea to keep a source of light on you at all times as comms are down due to the intensisty of spookiness at the spookyball! (PDAs work though!)

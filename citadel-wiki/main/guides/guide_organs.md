# Organ damage

Organ damage will cause side-effects as they reach thresholds, which will alert the owner when passed. If an organ shows up as "non-functional", that means its failing, and will not work, and will cause some life-threatening ailments depending on which organ it is. There is currently no way to see the exact damage of each organ, but for the most part they function on low-threshold, high-threshold, and failing, which will show up as "mildly damaged", "severely damaged", and "non-functional" lists when you scan someone with a medical scanner. Note that all the listed organs decay over time, which is the most common way they'll get damaged- but [[Surgery#Cybernetic_Organs|synthetic organs]] do not! The best way to avoid any of these side-effects is to replace your fleshy organs for [[Surgery#Cybernetic_Organs|metallic ones]], though these too come with downsides in the form of EMP vulnerability.

## Ways of getting damaged:

* Flashes and sharp objects in the eyes (eyes)
* Loud noises (ears)
* Appendicitis (appendix)
* Overly strong stomach acid
* High metabolic stress
* Collapsed lung
* Otherwise, an organ that's not in a living body (thus is on the ground or in a dead body) will decay if not held in a freezer, fridge, morgue unit, or [[Machines#Smartfridge|organ smartfridge]]. Organs will go from perfectly healthy to broken in 25 minutes, except for hearts, which will decay completely in 5 minutes, and brains, which will decay completely in 30 minutes.

## Side-Effects:

* Damaged ears will occasionally flare up with tinnitus, causing very brief deafness, with increasingly frequent bouts until the ears are non-functional, at which point you become deaf.
* Damaged eyes will grow increasingly short-sighted, until finally becoming blind when non-functional.
* Damaged lungs will increase the rate at which you breath by 25%, and will collapse if non-functional, causing rapid suffocation. Life-threatening!
* A non-functional appendix will burst, causing toxin damage until the organ is removed. Life-threatening!
* A damaged heart will increase the rate at which you breath by 25%, and will cease when non-functional, causing immediate heart attack. Life-threatening!
* A damaged stomach will be unable to hold nutriment and food down as easily, causing vomiting depending on the amount of food consumed and the damage of the stomach. A non-functional stomach does not digest any food.
* A collapsed lung will stress the heart and reduce functional breathing.
* A stressed liver will cause (dependant on the stress level) liver damage, then tox, then heart damage, then stamina loss, finally resulting in swelling of the liver.
* A stomach with high pH within it will cause stomach damage, then lung damage, then burning on the chest, and then heart and tongue damage at extreme values. 

## How to detect the condition of an Organ:
* A hand scanner will tell you what organs are Chronic or worse as well as lobe + swelling status.
* An advance scanner will tell you what organs are Acute or worse.
* Both scanners can detect Brain traumas.
* A sleeper can detect metabolic stress.
* The Magnetic Resonance Scanner (MRS) will scan all organs, and give you real time information on all of them, including metabolic stress, lung lobe collapse detection, brain traumas and pH.

# Organ effects
Each organ has 100 max hp, except the brain which has 200, and the lungs which has 300.

## Types of damage

An organ can suffer either Acute, Chronic or End Stage Failure which will limit what treatments are available to it and the potency of the effects applied. A normal health scanner can only detect chronic to end stage, while an advanced can see acute too.

# Treatment Options

 Depending on the severity, different treatment options are available for each organ. One of the most versatile options is Grafting Synthtissue to an organ. Synthtissue can be grafted to any organ to repair some of the damage, using 10u of the solution each step. This step can be repeated with 10u each time to continue treating the patient. It's important to note, however, that the patient will slowly metabolise synthtissue if you take too long. The strength of the treatment is equal to the colony size.

## Universal Treatment Options

### Synthtissue colony size and effects.

Synthtissue's effects depend on how long the colony has been growing, thus it's recomended to grow some as early as possible.

When applied by touch on a living person, it will treat Brute and burn damage instantly based on colony growth size and volume. If used on the dead, it will rapidly treat non organ damage to prepare for defib. If a patient is treated while dead, the urgency of the touch application will cause toxin and clone damage from the imperfect cell merging process and follow up treatment should be given to the patient. Under no circumstances should dead touch applied synthtissue be purged, and this will dramatically damage the patient when removed.

If they are revived this way, the synthtissue can only keep them alive for so long, effectively giving them a "borrowed health". Follow up treatment is heavily recommended to combat the resulting toxin and clone damage. If the patient is given a purge, they will take severe damage, and thus purging agents should be avoided until synthtissue is through their system.

  </tr>
</table>

One way to create a large amount is to create a big batch of the reactants, set the pH and temperature, then pour it in multiple beakers so they all grow simultaneously.

### Revival surgery

A researchable surgery which allows you to bring any corpse back to life. Performing this surgery will work regardless of the time of death and will restore any end stage organs to chronic levels.

### Emergency Cardioversion Induction

An emergency surgery useful for reviving a person within the defib limit, but with a end stage brain or heart. Will bring any corpses back to life with chronic heart and brain failure. Also useful for emergency revivals in situations with no defib available, just use a power cell or an inducer. 

### Transplant

Transplanting in a new organ is potentially the easiest and fastest way to restore organ functionality. Just make sure the patient is not suffering from a bacterial infection, as this will transfer across(NOT IMPLEMENTED YET).

# Organ specific treatments

## Brain <img src="https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/3/3f/Brain.png"></img>
As the brain becomes damaged, it has a chance of gaining random [[Guide_to_Traumas|brain traumas]] and other problems. If a brain reaches 0% health, the person dies. To be able to see exact brain health, you need an advanced health analyzer, which [[CMO]] gets one of by default. Getting killed and cloned does not cure brain traumas. 
### Ways of getting damaged:
- Imperfect cloning.
- Certain chemicals such as [[Guide_to_chemistry#Mercury|mercury]], [[Guide_to_chemistry#Impedrezene|impedrezene]], or [[Guide_to_chemistry#Fentanyl|fentanyl]]
- Abusing certain [[Guide_to_chemistry#Drugs|drugs]].
- [[Chaplain]]'s bible applied to the head.
- [[Blood Cult|Unholy Water]]
- [[Infections#Infection_Listings|Brainrot]]
- Earthsblood from [[Guide_to_hydroponics#Plants|Ambrosia Gaia]].
### Treatment:
#### Universal:
- [[Surgery#Brain_Surgery|Brain Surgery]], will fix brain damage also cure ## severe##  traumas. You can identify severe brain traumas by the prefix "severe" on health analyzer. [[Nanites#Healing_Programs|Nanites]] can cure these and lower level traumas. 
- [[Surgery#Lobotomy|Lobotomy]] will cure ## deep-rooted brain traumas## . You can identify deep-rooted brain traumas by the prefix "deep-rooted" on health analyzer. Some [[Virus#Symptoms_Table|viruses]] can cure these and lower level traumas. 
#### Acute:
-	Mannitol will slowly treat acute level damage.
-	Neuro-Smash will also treat acute brain damage slowly.
#### Chronic:
-	Pure Mannitol will slowly treat chronic and acute level damage.
-	Neurine will treat chronic and acute level damage, and cure basic brain traumas. These traumas have no prefix on health analyzer.
#### End stage:
-	Injecting pure Neurine into a corpse, or splashing a disembodied brain with neurine will restore a brain back to chronic levels of damage for a short time.

#### Permanent :
Brain traumas that are either permanent or curable with magic, which is typically unavailable. Failing a lobotomy can cause these traumas. You can identify permanent brain traumas by the prefix "permanent" on health analyzer. If you get one of these, then assume "this is life now".

## Heart <img src="https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/d/d9/Heart.png"></img>
The heart is usually damaged due to secondary effects of other organs under duress.
### Ways of getting damaged:
-	High metabolic stress
-	Extreme Acid reflux/bile reflux
-	Collapsed lung
### Treatment:
#### Acute:
-	Corazone will slowly treat acute level damage and prevent sudden onset cardiac arrest.
#### Chronic:
-	Pure Corazone (>0.95) will very slowly treat Chronic heart damage
#### End stage:
-	Coronary bypass
-	Emergency Cardioversion Induction
-	[[Surgery#Coronary_Bypass|A coronary bypass]] can be performed on a heart that's decayed past 60 damage, and restores functionality. Good for getting a heart that's too damaged to defib to work again.

## Liver ![Liver](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/f/f7/Liver_organ.png)
Healthy livers prevent toxic reagents effects when their metabolic stress is below 15. A stressed liver will cause (dependant on the stress level) liver damage, then tox, then heart damage, then stamina loss, finally resulting in swelling of the liver. Swelling will increase the blood requirements of the patient and slow them down. The only means of treatment at the moment for a swollen liver is transplantation.
### Ways of getting damaged:
-	Too much alcohol
-	Toxin ingestion
- 	Metabolic stress
### Treatment:
#### Acute & Chronic:
-	Livers will only heal when their metabolic stress is reduced past 0.
-	Soothehol will slowly treat metabolic stress based on it's purity (Byproduct of Antihol, it's purity is equal to Antihol's impurity, up until 0.3.).  Soothhol at purities >0.66 can push a liver's metabolic stress into chronic healing levels.
-	Dialysis on sleepers will reduce a liver's metabolic stress into acute treatment levels when tier 2, or chronic treatment levels when tier 4. Dialysis has to be left on for a period of time to reach chronic treatment levels.
-	Hepatectomy
#### End stage:
-	Hepatectomy

## Lungs <img src="https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/2/23/Lungs.png"></img>
Lungs are unusual in that they have more health than most organs, and will take longer to treat. When a lung fails for the first time, one of the lobes collaspes first, before the other. If both lobes deflate it will enter end stage failure. A collapsed lung will stress the heart and reduce functional breathing. Lobectomies additionally can only be performed once, and will cause very minor negative effects on affected lungs..
### Ways of getting damaged:
-	Impure Yamerol
-	Breathing very hot/very cold air.
-	Acid/bile reflux
-	Multiver
### Treatment:
#### Collapsed lung:
-	Yamerol will temporarily reinflate collapsed lungs on overdose.
-	Lobectomy
#### Acute:
-	Yamerol
#### Chronic:
-	(>0.9) purity Yamerol
#### End stage:
-	Lobectomy
-	Yamerol overdose will fill in for a missing lung, granting them temporary lungs that will slowly decay without Yamerol present.

## Appendix <img src="https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/9/98/Appendix.png"></img>
### Ways of getting damaged:
-	Appendicitis 
### Treatment:
#### Universal:
-	Removing the appendix with surgery.

## Stomach <img src="https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/f/f7/Stomach_organ.png"></img>
The stomach repairs itself quicker than other organs when within healthy pH and thus treatments are usually secondary rather than primary. A stomach with high pH within it will cause stomach damage, then lung damage, then burning on the chest, and then heart and tongue damage at extreme values. If a patients system is purged from non dialysis methods, it will also purge stomach acid from the patient. A health patient usually has 50u of acid, and will regenerate it slowly. If acid is regenerated, their pH will shoot up. If they have no acid to purge, they will take direct stomach damage.
### Ways of getting damaged:
-	Very acidic/basic stomach acid pH
### Treatment:
-	Neutralise internal pH and let natural regeneration fix it.
-	Antacids will neutralise acidic stomach conditions quickly and sooth acute damage.
-	Antbases will neutralise basic stomach conditions quickly and sooth acute damage.
#### End stage:
-	There is no specific treatment for stomachs, rely on transplantation or grafting SuperSomatic Synthtissue.

## Eyes ![Eyes](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/5/57/Eyes.png)
### Ways of getting damaged:
-	Bright flashes
-	Using the welder without protection
### Treatment:
#### Acute + Chronic:
-	Oculine will slowly treat eye damage and treat some other sources of blindness
-	Eye surgery
#### End stage:
-	Pure Oculine can restore non-functional eyes.
-	Eye surgery

## Ears <img src="https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/e/ec/Ears.png"></img>
### Ways of getting damaged:
-	Loud noises
### Treatment:
#### Acute + Chronic:
-	Inacusiate will slowly treat ear damage.
#### End stage:
-	Pure Inacusiate will instantly restore all ear function.

## Tongue <img src="https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/c/c4/Tongue.png"></img>
### Ways of getting damaged:
- Consuming high pH stuff
### Treatment
#### Acute + Chronic:
- Yamerol
#### End stage:
- Yamerol OD
- Replacement

Guide to Cloning
===

Death is inevitable even in the 26th century, but unlike the days of old it isn't necessarily the end. When resuscitation fails, there is another option: **cloning**. Provided someone hasn't signed a DNR, or "Do Not Resuscitate" order and their ghost is still present (meaning the player hasn't disconnected or found a new life in a [ghost role]()), you'll be able to return them to the realm of the living.

**A message from the gods:** *"Those who return from the afterlife are not to take any newfound information with them. You may however recall everything from your past life, up to the point of blacking out/losing consciousness. See [Rule 5.5](https://katlin.dog/citadel-rules/main#rule-5-do-not-metagame)."*

## Die Another Day
Modern Nanotrasen stations feature a state-of-the-art Cloning Room within their medbay, which is where you'll most likely carry out said task. The more of the person you can bring in the better, but **the bare minimum required is their brain**.

Although primarily intended to bring back the deceased, you may find living crew itching to get scanned, particularly those in high-risk jobs such as [Shaft Miners](/citadel-wiki/main/roles/cargo/shaft_miner.md) or [Security Officers](/citadel-wiki/main/roles/security/security_officer.md). In the Citadel sector of space **it's on you to provide a reason for someone not to be scanned**, as opposed to them proving they're worthy of being scanned, so odds are you should just scan them. It won't let you create a living copy of them then and there, but these "pre-scans" nearly ensure they can be cloned later if need be - odds are they'll be in better shape now than they would be coming in later. **Whether dead or alive, the process is the same:** insert the person in the DNA Scanner, close it, then consult the Cloning Console.



Press "Start Scan" - it'll tell you if the scan succeeded. Sometimes you may need to "Refresh" it first. When it's time to bring someone back, you'll want to "View Records" and choose the person you wish to clone by selecting their record. You could delete them too, but it isn't often you're going to outside of dealing with [antagonists](/citadel-wiki/main/roles/antagonist).

If the Cloning Pod turns green and something starts to form inside it, you've got a clone en route! If you happen to have their body, you may want to strip it and place their belongings together for their clone to collect, otherwise you can let the clone do the dirty work. Regardless, you should dispose of their old body in the morgue once they're back up on their feet, along with marking it cloned so the [Chaplain](/citadel-wiki/main/roles/civillian/chaplain.md) can deal with it.

#### [Plasmamen]() in particular require special procedures when it comes to cloning:

- If they get prescanned, look into getting a spare Plasmaman Suit as soon as possible. They may be ready to be cloned before their original body is found, so talk to the cargo department if needed.

- You'll want them under a shower as soon as they come out of the cloning pod, especially if you don't have a spare plasmaman suit on hand. Unfortunately, not every station you'll be working on had the foresight to place one nearby.

- If they don't have a suit, they'll need a way to breathe while stuck in the shower. [Salbutamol](/citadel-wiki/main/guides/guide_chemistry.md#salbutamol) will stave off suffocation damage, in the meantime engineering may be able to get you a plasma tank more quickly than cargo can get you a suit.

## Technical Dilemmas
Unfortunately, the cloning process isn't always a straightforward one.
#### If you find yourself unable to clone someone, consult the following checklist:

- **Are they alive?** [Normally](#ethical-difficulties---the-prototype-cloner), it isn't possible to clone a living person, but as mentioned earlier the act of prescanning will all but ensure they can be cloned if needed.

- **Are they a husk?** If their corpse is particularly grey and groaty, they may have been husked. Unless your cloner is upgraded, you may need to surgically remove the brain and scan that. If that doesn't work, you may well have a victim of a [changeling](/citadel-wiki/main/roles/antagonist) and there's nothing you can do.

- **Are they headless or without a brain?** See if you can get a blood sample if you don't already have one. If so, get the blood and body to botany - [it's their problem now](/citadel-wiki/main/roles/service/botanist.md). Otherwise, they're staying six feet under.

- **Do you know exactly how they were killed?** Although it's impossible to be certain unless you were a witness (or even their murderer), if you know they were husked by a changeling, sharded by a [blood cultist](/citadel-wiki/main/roles/antagonist), or took their own life, they aren't coming back.

- **Have you tried more than once?** Ghosts aren't always aware of what's going on with their old body right away. Some may need time to make their way back to it.

#### Beyond that there's also what each specific error code means, past the blatantly obvious ones:

- **Initialisation failure:** They ain't dead yet, or their ghost is trapped somewhere.

- **Mental interface failure** A fairly common one, it just means their ghost isn't nearby. Sometimes all it takes is a few more tries, but if that doesn't work you can assume the worst.

- **Unable to locate valid genetic data:** You can't clone non-humanoids - talk to mining about getting a Lazarus Injector instead.

- **Subject no longer contains the fundamental materials required to create a living clone:** You've got a husk or someone that's otherwise taken too much damage and your cloner isn't upgraded enough to compensate. Remove their brain and scan that.

- **Subject's brain is not responding to scanning stimuli:** Either they committed suicide or [made a deal with the devil](/citadel-wiki/main/roles/antagonist). They're gone, Jim.

- **Unable to initiate cloning cycle:** You shouldn't see this one - if you do, pray (or ahelp it) since cloning is out of the question.

There's also the possibility clones can come out improperly, particularly when the cloner isn't upgraded. Power failures or [emags]() can eject clones prematurely, and they'll likely perish quickly unless they can get into a cryogenic tube. Even complete clones may want to look towards similar treatment if they come out with "cellular damage".

Specifically with unupgraded cloners, people may be reborn with random (usually negative) [mutations](), although it's usually nothing mutadone and/or mannitol can't fix. Some may come out of the pod with [traumas](), which require [further medical attention]() to get rid of. There's even been cases of people coming back with a different gender, which while not quite on the level of brain surgery takes a lot more than pills to fix.

## Ethical Difficulties - The Prototype Cloner
Cloning is still a relatively new technology, but old prototype cloners can still be found amongst the cosmos. You may remember hearing that you can't clone someone who's already alive - as it turns out, there's good reason for that. Should you come across one these old prototypes, you'll find out precisely why.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmeraldSundisk/Citadel-Wiki/master/citadel-wiki-static/cakevapechasecropped.png "Prototype clones can quite different from the person they're a clone of.")

Although it can't be upgraded like modern cloners, it **will** produce clones of living persons, minus the genitalia. That's not the only issue, however: it might not act exactly like you since it isn't you. Your clone is controlled by another player. When a prototype clone is made, it puts out an offer to any ghosts present to become a "defective" clone. If none accept, it comes out as braindead as a [humanized monkey](). Antagonists should note that while possible, it's highly unlikely their clone will also be an antagonist - likewise, it's an equally small chance that a non-antagonist's clone will be an antagonist.

**Another word from the gods:** *"Once again, you're not to take any knowledge from the afterlife back into the realm of the living. In the case of prototype cloners, the same goes for anything that happened during the round, even if the person you're a clone of experienced it firsthand."*

If you're a ghost and interested in being someone's defective clone but don't know them well enough or think you can do their character justice, don't worry! Most people are just happy to have a sentient clone and you're not meant to be a carbon copy of them anyway. You can try (but are no means limited to) some of the following gimmicks:
- Strongly exaggerate what character traits you know they have (i.e. if you're Julio Steele, be the most stereotypical Mexican you can imagine)
- Being who they are in rumors/running jokes (i.e. if you're Chase Redtail, go cockvore spiders)
- Define yourself with a single trait (happy, emo, romantic/French, clown, "cool", devilish, etc.)
- If all else fails, hang with them and try to emulate them as best you can

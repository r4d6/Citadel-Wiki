# Guide to chemistry

This guide will primarily be useful for chemists but may come in handy to any player and especially traitors. See Chemical recipes for detailed instructions on how to make complicated chemicals, and for info about using the dispenser's recipe recording function. If you don't have a chem dispenser, see the [Guide to Ghetto Chemistry](citadel-wiki/main/guides/guide_getto_chems). 

## Tools of the trade

![#ChemDisp](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/a/a6/Dispenser.png) The <b>Chem Dispenser</b> turns electrical energy into a variety of basic chemicals, through magic science. Guard it with your life. If you run out of power, you can disassemble the dispenser with screwdriver+crowbar and rebuild it by first putting the circuit board back, and then all other things but use a full power cell ![PowerCell](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/d/de/Power_cell.png) instead of the old one. Then screwdriver to finish. Or you can charge the machine with an inducer ![Inducer](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/f/f3/Inducer.png). The machine has a built in pH meter and will tell you the pH as you inject chemicals into your beaker, the accuracy being equal to it's upgrades.

![ChemMast](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/9/95/Chemmaster.gif) The <b>ChemMaster 3000</b> can magically separate chemicals, <b> but not isomers</b> and has the ability to produce a limitless supply of 50 unit pills, 40 unit patches and 30 unit bottles. It can also scan a reagent to give an analysis on the synthesis, accurate purity and optimal pH of a reagent's reaction.

![Grinder](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/3/39/Blender.png) The <b>Reagent Grinder</b> is identical to the grinder the Chef has. It can be used to extract chemical reagents from things the Shaft Miners, Chef, and Botanists produce (See [Ground Reagents](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#GROUND-REAGENTS))

![Heater](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/b/bf/Chemheater.png) The <b>Chemical Heater</b> is important for making many recipes that require high temperatures to mix. This is extemely useful in [Fermi Reactions](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#FERMI) to control the temperature of the reaction. As the heater is upgraded, the accuracy of the pH detection increases in turn, with a fully upgraded heater capable of detecting reagent purity. The heater is capable of accepting injection of chems into the beaker contained within via a ![Syringe](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/b/be/Syringes.png)Syringe or a ![Dropper](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/7/7a/Eyedropper.png)Dropper.

<b>pH paper</b> can tell you the rough pH by putting it into the beaker. The colour of the strip will indicate what the pH is.

The <b>Chem analyser</b> can give you an indepth analysis of everything in a beaker, notably, the purity and pH. Very useful for ghetto reactions. Can be printed from the autolathe. Toggle the object to give a detailed or reduced analysis.

![PillBox](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/c/c1/Pillsbox.png) Inside the chemistry locker you will find boxes of <b>pill bottles</b> ![PillBot](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/a/ae/Pillbottle.png)on some maps. These can be loaded with pills for inventory space efficiency, holding 7 patches or pills.

![SprayBox](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/d/d5/Writingbox.png) <b>Medical sprays</b> are kept in the same locker. These can be filled with chemicals by using the ChemMaster. They work as patches and provide an optional way to apply medicine. ![MedSpray](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/e/ec/Medicalspray.png)

![Syringe](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/b/be/Syringes.png) The <b>syringe</b> is a container especially used for holding liquids. A syringe can hold up to 15/10/60 units (normal/percing/bluespace) depending on type and will survive reactions happening inside of it in spite of appearances. They have two modes -- inject and draw. While in draw mode, a syringe takes liquids from other liquid containers such as bottles and beakers and even people 5 mg at a time. While in inject mode it will push its contents 5 mg at a time into a target, including other containers. Syringes can be injected into food and drinks, even those still sitting on a table.

They are most often found inside syringe boxes in the open around medbay or in medical lockers or in medical crates ordered from the Quartermaster. Medical dispensers also provide a number of empty syringes. 

![Dropper](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/7/7a/Eyedropper.png) The <b>Dropper</b> is a container used for holding 5u of liquids. An empty dropper will store liquids from other liquid containers such as bottles and beakers. Once full, you can squirt the contents of the dropper at any target adjacent or below you, including other liquid containers, or on people's faces. Toggle in hand to change it to drop one to five units at a time, this is extemely useful for fine tuning the pH of a beaker.

<b>Buffers</b> are reagents that alter the pH of a mixture towards [acidity (0)](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#acidic-buffer) or [alkalinity (14)](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#basic-buffer). These liquids dissiplate into a mixture, unless [stabilizing agent](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#stabilizing-agent) is added.

## Reagent containers

<b>It is important to note that strong acids/bases can melt most glass based beakers, while plastic beakers will melt from heat. They will melt slowly over time with a audiable noise. If you heat them melting, either drop the temperature or adjust the pH!</b>


![Bottle](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/5/5d/Bottle.png) Bottles are small 30 unit containers made from a hardened mesh of glass and polymers, and thus <b>don't melt from temperature or pH</b>. These are produced by the ChemMaster 3000.

![Beaker](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/8/8c/Beaker.png)![LargeBeak](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/f/fc/Large_Beaker.png) Beakers holds 50/100 units of liquid depending on size, but begins to <b>melt under strong acids or bases.</b> These can be printed from the autolathe.

![PlastBeaker](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/8/83/XL_beaker.png) XL beakers are made of plastic and hold 150 units of liquid. <b> They are immune to pH, but will being to melt when containing liquids over 444K.</b> These can be printed from the autolathe using plastic sheets.

![MetaBeak](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/c/c0/Meta_beaker.png) Meta Beakers holds 200 units of liquid and is <b>immune to pH and will not melt under high temperature</b>. These can be printed from the autolathe when researched.

![CyroBeak](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/5/5e/Cryostasis_beaker.gif) Cryostasis Beakers holds 50 units of liquid.
Chemicals will not mix, react or change temperature while in this beaker. Splashing contained chemicals will not make them react either, as with all other beakers. <b>This beaker is immune to pH and will not melt under high temperature.</b> These can be printed from the autolathe when researched.

![BlueBeak](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/5/5b/Bluespace_beaker.gif) Bluespace beakers are the largest beakers and hold 300 units of liquid. <b> These are weak to strong acids/bases, but have more durability than standard beakers.</b> These can be printed from the autolathe when researched.

![WBottle](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/9/9f/Waterbottle.png)![LargeBottle](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/a/ab/Large_water_bottle.png) Water Bottles Can be made with plastic sheets. Works like a beaker but comes with a cap to prevent spilling. Toggle the cap with alt-click. Holds 50/100 units of liquid depending on side. <b> Weak to strong acids/bases and temperatures over 444K.</b>


## Medicine types

Reagents can be dispenced as various different types:

![Pill](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/8/89/MutadonePill.png) <b>Pills</b> are able to hold up to 50 units of reagents and apply their contained reagents via ingestion. If the pH of the pill is too high, it will damage the tongue of the patient, as such it is recommended to neutralise the pH with buffers or other reagents when dispensing. 

![Patch](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/3/3e/Bandaid_brute.png) <b>Patches</b> are able to hold up to 40 units of reagent and apply via touch. The pH of a touching reagent has no damaging effects on patients, thus neutralisation is not necessary.

![Bottle](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/5/5d/Bottle.png) <b>Bottles</b> simply contain the liquid in a hardy storage, and can either be drunk (susceptible to burning the tongue) or injected.

<b>Hypovials</b> are used with hypospray, which either inject or spray the patient with the contained reagents for 5/10 units. These vials can hold up to 60 units.

<b>Smoke</b> is produced either by smoke reactions or vaping. Inhalation of a reagent mix with a strong acidity or alkalinity with cause tongue damage, and thus neutralisation is recommended.

<b>Smart darts</b> Smart darts contain up to 20 units of reagent soaked into the mechanism (and thus cannot be removed). These darts will inject a chem right up to the overdose limit when shot into a patient using the Smartdart Gun. Unfortunately, it requires a high velocity to penitrate the skin, and thus cannot be used in hand.

# What should I make first?

Generally, it's a good idea to have something for each of the 5 main damage types; Brute, Burn, Toxin, Suffocation and Genetic.

### Brute
- [Bicard](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#bicaridine) is a classic healing for brute, but has an OD at 30u.
- [Styptic Powder](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#styptic-powder) heals on application and heals as fast as bicard, but is harder to make
- [Salicyclic Acid](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#salicyclic-acid) is useful for really damaged patients.

### Burn
- [Kelotane](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#kelotane) is a classic healing for burn, but has an OD at 30u.
- [Silver Sulfadiazine](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#silver-sulfadiazine) heals on application and heals as fast as bicard, but is harder to make
- [Oxandrolone](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#oxandrolone) is useful for really damaged patients, but less so for weak burns.

### Toxin
- [Charcoal](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#charcoal) is good in a pinch, but will purge all other chems too.
- [AntiToxin](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#anti-toxin) is good for toxins, and will purge any [toxin reagents](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#toxins)
- [Pentetic Acid](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#pentetic-acid) Is the fastest purger, toxic treatment, and also treats radiation.

Bear in mind all of these will murder slimes, as toxin healing damages slimepeople.
For general purging of reagents, rather than treatment of toxin damage, use [Calomel](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#calomel), which is also the only viable purger for slimes.

### Oxygen
- [Epinephrine](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#epinephrine) Will limit oxygen loss to 35.
- [Salbutamol](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#salbutamol) Will treat oxygen loss.

### Genetic
- [Clonexadone](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#clonexadone) when used in a cyrotube/cold shower will treat genetic damage.

### Radiation
- [Potassium Iodide](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#potassium-iodide)
- [Pentetic Acid](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#pentetic-acid) Is the fastest purger, toxic treatment, and also treats radiation.

After that, it's useful to create organ treatment chems; [Mannitol](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#mannitol) for brain, [Inacusiate](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#inacusiate) for ears, [Oculine](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#oculine) for eyes, [Synthflesh](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#synthflesh) for prepping the dead for defibbing, and if you're feeling up to it,  [Yamerol](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#yamerol) for lungs and [Synthtissue](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#synthtissue) for grafting surgeries.


# Handling reactions

For a list of all reactions, see [Chemical Reactions](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies). Most reactions simply require each reagent to be present in the beaker in sufficient quantities in order to react, while a few require heating. If you are new, it’s recommended to get used to the simpler reactions first, and stock the fridge full of helpful chemicals. A few of the reactions, however, are advanced reactions, which require a bit more consideration to produce successfully. A good chemist will keep an eye on a reactions temperature, pH and purity when producing chems.

## Do like an otter, add acid to water.
Adding water to a strong acid (less then pH 2) is like adding fuel to a fire, and it will cause it to areolate into the air. Be careful to either add water <b>first</b> or neutralise your strong acids before adding water to your beaker.

## Temperature
All reactions that are non-instant have a reaction rate tied to the temperature of a beaker. If a chemical is reacting too slowly, simply heat the beaker up to speed it up. As a reaction occurs, it is either <b>Exothermic (heat producing)</b> or <b>Endothermic (heat consuming)</b>. Care should be taken for the Exothermic reactions, as they are liable to overheat and explode, <b> Always check your reaction kinetics first, and in particular, take care around a reactions explosion temperature</b>. The rate in which a reaction heats up is faster the hotter it is, be careful to not lose control, and run if you do.

## Reaction explosions
Generally, an explosion will depend on what is reacting, and what is present in the beaker. Plasma for example will ignite when given a heat source, and thus should be treated with respect. <b>A chemist that doesn’t respect the chemicals they’re handling, often ends up a dead chemist, be careful</b>. As a general rule for explosions; the larger the volume, the more dangerous it is. As such, you can use large volumes of chems to adjust your pH, but if you fail the explosion is more dangerous. Alternatively, you can use buffers that adjust the pH, which self consume on addition (and thus do not add to the total volume).

## Potential of Hydrogen (pH)
Every chemical has an innate pH, which can be seen [here]((citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies). The pH of the beaker is the sum of the pHes in the mix. The pH of a beaker determines how pure a product is, for the recipes with a given pH, you want to have your pH at the centre of the limits when the reaction starts. As a reaction progresses, it’s likely the pH will begin to drift, and must be compensated for either with [buffer reagents]( buffers--acidic-buffer-or--basic-buffer) or acidic/alkaline compounds. The pH range is something chemists often have to learn over several reactions, and the <b>ChemMaster 3000</b> analyse function can give an insight into what pH you should be aiming for. <b>Highly impure compounds are liable to explode too</b> thus it is prudent to set your pH before reacting. The impure explosion threshold is given by the <i>Minimum Purity</i>.

## Purity
Purity of a reagent is determined by how pure your reactants were, and how optimal the pH was during the reaction. If the product is slightly impure, it’ll split into the <i>impure chem</i>, if it is highly impure, it will invert <b>all of the product</b> into the <i>inverse chem</i>. Impure chems are listed [here](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#impure-reagents)
A good example of this is [Synthetic derived growth factor](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#synthetic-derived-growth-factor), ingesting 10u SDGF at 0.8 purity will give you 8u [SDGF](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#synthetic-derived-growth-factor) and 2u [SDGFTox](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#synthetic-derived-apoptosis-factor), ingesting 10u SDGF at 0.4 purity (less than it’s InverseChemVal) will result in 10u [SDZF](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies##synthetic-derived-zombie-factor). Reacting it at less than 0.2 purity will cause it to “explode” and produce a teratoma.

## General tips
- The explosion size in influenced by the beakers volume. It is <b>highly recommended</b> that you react small quantities of reactants in a beaker to ensure safety. <b>The more volume you have, the more that is available to exothermically react too</b>. Buffers are useful for keeping a reactions volume low.
- Make sure your pH is correct before heating up the reaction, If it's not reacting, this is usually the problem, after the reaction has started however, it will keep going past the limits, <b>producing 100% impure products</b>.
- Take a note of how your pH changes across the reaction and adjust beforehand accordingly, or have some buffer handy to inject into the reaction in the middle of it.
- You can abort reactions by crashing the temperature and hoping it’s not exothermic enough to overcome that anyways. Alternatively, you could throw the beaker in a panic.
- Upgrading the heater and the dispenser will improve their ability to detect pH.
- For some reactions, it can be useful to keep reagents away from each other until both of them have optimal conditions.
- Temperature of buffers will change the temperature of whatever you're adding it to! Make sure to not pour hot buffer into a temperature sensitive reaction!

## Walkthrough of your first Fermireaction

A good first step onto the road to chemical mastery is to produce some basic buffer. [Basic buffer](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#basic-buffer) will test your basic understanding of chemistry by asking for lye.


1. Add 1 part Lye, 2 parts ethanol, 2 parts water and at least 1u of sulphuric acid to a XL beaker (the beaker will resist the intense pH).
2. Dropper in 1u of Sulphuric acid.
3. Notice how your reaction is abysmally slow, and remember that heat = reaction rate!
4. Heat the beaker to 443K, as heating it above 444K will melt the beaker. If you're using a metabeaker, heat that bad boy up even more and give yourself a gold star.
5. Cool the beaker back down after the reaction.
6. Separate out the buffer.


You're now ready to react [Eigenstasium](citadel-wiki/main/guides/chem_recipies#eigenstasium).

1. Add the 3 reagents into a glass beaker in equal parts, while keeping total volume low incase of explosion.
2. Adjust your pH to 8 (the center of the range (2 - 14))
3. Heat the beaker to 355K
4. Remember that reaction rate = heat!
5. Remember that Eigenstasium is exothermic, and may get away from you if you're too keen.
6. Put your reaction rate to a sensible 450K, and watch it to ensure it doesn't get too close to the explosion temperature (650K).
6.5 If the reaction starts getting too hot, crash the temperature to 1K and pray it's not too late.
7. Adjust the pH during the reaction to keep it around 8 using a dropper or a syringe with basic buffer in.
8. Enjoy wiggly cosmic dust. (But don't OD!)

If you're able to make these two reactions successfully, you should be ready to tackle the other ones on your own. Bear in mind the others can be more difficult, and should be approached with a thoughtful demeanor.
Also give yourself a headpat for doing so well!

Quartermaster
===

"Cargo, move freight! Miners, don't die!" - Randolph P. Checkers, Esq.

The **Quartermaster** is the ruler of Cargonia and effectively the head of the supply department, despite technically answering to the /Head of Personnel/. They wear the pants in the cargo family (metaphorically speaking if they wear a jumpskirt), although their day-to-day job isn't much different than a standard /Cargo Technician/'s, which they'll be expected to know how to do. For this reason however, it's arguably the most approachable of the /head roles/.

## It's Good to Be King/Queen:
The long pants and brown vest are merely one perk you'll have over your technicians - as a department head, you'll get access to the mining department, the bridge, shuttle cockpits, the command radio channel (:c), a headset with loud mode, and whatever you might find in your office. You'll have greater control over what passes through Cargonia than your lesser counterparts, and the authority to send your technicians out to do the legwork. As for your Shaft Miners, you can request they keep an eye out for particular ores should someone request it.

However, there is a cost to all this power. Your kingdom swears fealty to Nanotrasen, meaning you must still heed the /Captain/'s orders and at least consider the opinions of fellow heads of staff. It'll be expected that you maintain enough of a budget surplus for a decent /escape shuttle/ to be purchased. You also may lack /some of/ /the things/ they possess, and no matter how much you claim to be "for the people", your regal status may be your downfall once /the revolution/ comes. Fortunately you aren't held liable for what happens to miners down on Lavaland, but you may wish to check up on them every now and then.

## So About That Revolution...
In the event of a /workers' revolt/, the supply department is a major focus for both sides, considering mindshields are one of the few things the station can't produce on its own. As a Quartermaster, odds are you're going to want some whether or not the rest of command demands you buy them. Although you can't /normally/ open the crates yourself, security will likely be willing to help, and you won't need to worry about mindshielding yourself, /unlike/ /other/ /crises/.
